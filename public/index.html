            <h3>websites</h3>
            <p>
              In todays world, Your website is highly likely to be the first
              point of contact with Your clients. It is obvious You'll want to
              make the best first impression possible. With the amount of
              options out there, you want your site to be performant, good
              looking, and easy to navigate. I can help with that.
            </p>

            <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt fa-2x"></i>
            <h3>Apps</h3>
            <p>
              Whenever a website responds to users behaviour, it can be called
              an app. Broadly speaking. Apps can be anything from a simple loan
              calculator, through property finder, all the way to social media
              sites. Whether you need a small Single Page Application to help
              your clients navigate through your service or product portfolio,
              or you need a sophisticated e-commerce site, feel free to get in
              touch.

            <h3>Backend Development</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike simple apps that live solely on users machine, most
              applications actually need a server to live on, usually with a
              database connection. Although I specialise in Frontend
              Development, I can also help with setting up Your server-side
              logic. Please get in touch so we can discuss Your exact needs.

          How does the magic happen
        </h2>
        <div class="bottom-line"></div>
        <p class="lead">
          If you're interested in my work process, I outline a simplified
          version below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul class="process">
        <li class="process-step">
          <h3>1.</h3>
          <p>
            Every successful project starts with a clarity of the goals. What is
            the desired outcome? Is it to increase your customer base? Do you
            need broader outreach? Or do you need a killer landing page to drive
            your sales through the roof?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="process-step">
          <h3>2.</h3>
          <p>
            Once we've established the purpose of the end product, the next step
            is drawing up a design. I always outsource this part to one of my
            associates who specialises in design, as they will be able to
            deliver a far superior result than me.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="process-step">
          <h3>3.</h3>
          <p>
            Once the designs are done and hashed out, it's time to decide what
            procedure will I use for getting the job done. Some projects will
            work better created via Functional programming paradigm, some
            deliver better results when done via Object Oriented Programming.
            Using the right tools for the job is half the success.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="process-step">
          <h3>4.</h3>
          <p>
            Now that everyhing is ready, it's time to write the code. Whenever
            possible, I like to get a draft with just simple markup and style
            reviewed by the client, so they can decide on any changes before I
            start writing all the logic.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="process-step">
          <h3>5.</h3>
          <p>
            Now for the real fun part. Giving the website or app its behaviour
            is one of the most fun jobs on Earth. The process can be often
            frustrating, but the feeling when all the pieces fall into place is
            like no other.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="process-step">
          <h3>6.</h3>
          <p>
            Once all the coding is done, there is always some back and forth
            communication with the client, and potentionally a backend
            developer, if the site/app requires it. Once everything is ready to
            be handed over, I like to bundle everything to increase performance,
            test for any undesired behaviour, and if everything works and looks
            great, deploy.
